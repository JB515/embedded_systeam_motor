# embedded_systeam_motor

## To Do

- [x] Get motor to spin.
- [ ] Convert start code to use threading and interrupts.
- [ ] Spin at a defined angular velocity.
- [ ] Spin for a defined number of rotations and stop without overshooting (using PID control with velocity as input).
- [ ] (optional) Set and hold the motor angle to the nearest 1°, rotate at low angular velocity (1°s-1).
- [ ] (optional) Make the motor play a tune as it works (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtUjIE3IHTA).
- [ ] (optional) Make the controller tune automatically when the moment of inertia (flywheel mass) is changed.
